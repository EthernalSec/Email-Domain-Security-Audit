# Methodology – Email & Domain Security Audit

The domain’s DNS records were reviewed to determine:
- Where email is received (MX)
- Who is allowed to send email (SPF)
- Whether email is cryptographically signed (DKIM)
- Whether spoofed email is blocked (DMARC)

These controls are the foundation of phishing and fraud prevention.
