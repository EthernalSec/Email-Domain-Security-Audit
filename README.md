# Email-Domain-Security-Audit
This project shows how EthernalSec evaluates whether attackers can send fake emails that appear to come from an organization. By reviewing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, the assessment identifies phishing and impersonation risk and provides clear steps to block fraudulent emails before they reach staff, donors, or customers.
